# E-Commerce

Small-scale businesses and startups had huge losses due to the pandemic. Hence, this system was designed to focus on those businesses which intend to venture into E-commerce to subsequently increase their sales and profits. This system provides complete solutions for vendors as well as customers through a single gateway. It allows a customer to place orders online for products sold from a store that serves both walk-in customers and online customers. It displays all the available products in a particular store. The customers can search the products and select the required products to add them to the cart. Then the customers can place their orders and make online payment through different payment modes available. The placed order is delivered. The customers can also cancel the order and request for refund.

I presented my idea to a **textile store** owner and gathered key **requirements** (audio link given below) necessary to establish his business in an online platform. I also took the liberty of introducing some improvisations of my own in addition to the requirements specified by him. Instead of using the term ‘Textile’, I have generalized this system to be used for any product-based business. **SRS** and **UML Diagrams** were made after hearing the requirements audio file and then the **User Interface** was designed using the **Figma** tool (powerpoint link given below).
